You are working on an international project and need to invoice your customers for the work you complete. The database you use contains an invoices table. 
The invoices table contains the following columns: InvoiceId, CustomerId, InvoiceDate, BillingAddress, BillingCity, BillingState, BillingCountry, BillingPostalCode,Total.
Create a query to return all the columns from this table for only customers in Germany who have an invoice total greater than $5. 

SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE
    BillingCountry = 'Germany' AND Total > 5
    
You are working on a project about music and have a table of tracks you need to sort.
The database you use contains a Tracks table. The table contains the following columns: TrackId, Name, AlbumId, MediaTypeId, GenreId, Composer, Milliseconds, 
Bytes, and UnitPrice. Write a SQL query to pull all columns from the Tracks table for only tracks with Chris Cornell as the composer.
Sort the results in descending order by GenreId.

SELECT 
*
FROM Tracks
WHERE Composer = 'Chris Cornell' 
ORDER BY GenreId DESC

Write a query so that it returns the top 10 counties with the highest birth counts for 2018 only and specifies only rows that have a Year value equal to 2018-01-01


SELECT *
FROM  
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality`  
WHERE Year = '2018-01-01' 
ORDER BY 
   Births DESC 
LIMIT  10 

You are working with a database table that contains invoice data. The table includes columns for invoice_line_id (line items for each invoice), 
invoice_id, unit_price, and quantity (the number of purchases in each line item). Each invoice contains multiple line items. You want to know the total price 
for each of the first 5 line items in the table. You decide to multiply unit price by quantity to get the total price for each line item, 
and use the AS command to store the total in a new column called line_total. 

Add a statement to your SQL query that calculates the total price for each line item and stores it in a new column as line_total. 

SELECT 
    invoice_line_id,
    invoice_id,
    unit_price,
    quantity,
    (unit_price*quantity) AS line_total
FROM
    invoice_item 
LIMIT 5
